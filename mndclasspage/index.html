  <p>Hi! My name is Devin Anderson-Torrez and I am a multimedia specialist at MLive. I am from Lansing, Michigan, and am grateful to report from within the great state I grew up in. I graduated from Michigan State University in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in journalism and minors in photojournalism and film studies. During my time at Michigan State University, I also studied in the Chicano/Latino Studies program. As someone who is mixed race, I hold my Mexican-American identity and roots with great pride and honor. I am curently obtaining my master's degree at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications, with a focus on innovative journalism. </p>

  <h2>Some of my favorite things are:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Movies. I enjoy classics like Jaws, Casablanca and It's a Wonderful Life, just as much as I enjoy goofy films like Nacho Libre, Hot Rod and Step Brothers. </li>
    <li>Baseball. Even to this day, I have played baseball in my life longer than I haven't. Now, I am more a fan than a player and enjoy watching baseball and photographing it.</li>
    <li>Spending time with my family. I am a very family-oriented person and am grateful for the time that I get to spend with them.</li>
